# Cinema Service

This is a REST service that talks to a MongoDB database alloing you to create, read, update and delete from it. It doesn't actually create real cinemas. 🎦 🍿 😱

It uses Node.js, Express, Mongoose, Jest, Docker, and TypeScript.

## Getting it running

The one prerequisite is that you must have Docker installed and running.

- Clone the repo
- `cd` into the directory
- run `yarn` or `npm install`, whichever you prefer
- Then run `docker-compose up --build`

You should then be able to poke the different endpoints, which will be described in Swagger docs at [http://localhost:7777/docs/](http://localhost:7777/docs/)

## Running the tests

At the moment, there are just unit tests run through `npm test` or `yarn test`, depending on which package manager you use.
